Building and Contributing
-

We use [Protobuild](http://protobuild.org) as a build generation system. You don't need anything to make it work. You will, however, need a C# capable IDE (MonoDevelop/XamarinStudio or Visual Studio).

Details on building and contributing can be found on our [Github Wiki](https://github.com/ss31/ss31/wiki).
